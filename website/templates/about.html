            <p>
                I'm a young dreamer and writer, born in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on June 18th, 2001, a couple of years after the Bosnian war. 
                My early days were spent in a humble orphanage until I was adopted by a Bosnian/Aussie couple from Australia. 
                I've always been drawn to storytelling, finding comfort in the escapist nature of movies, manga, and anime, especially when life got tough. Originally, 
                I wanted to be a filmmaker, but life had other plans. My goal is to change the world by changing myself, and in my mind, this is the very first step. So, who am I? 
                I am the savior of my own universe.
